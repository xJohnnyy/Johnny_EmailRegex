# Johnny_EmailRegex

## Description.
In this module challenges we created a Regex tutorial using GitHub Gist. The tutorial that you will find in my gist is how to validate the featured email address regular expression : '/^([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})$/'. The tutorial breaksdown each component of the regex and provides a thorough explanation. After reading the Gist the readwer will understand how the regex functions to validate an email address. 



## The following sources were consultaed in the making of my Gist: 
1. https://emaillistvalidation.com/blog/the-power-of-regular-expressions-in-email-validation-a-comprehensive-guide/
2. https://www.akto.io/tools/email-regex-Javascript-tester
3. https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php
4. https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-using-a-regular-expression/
5. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/201323/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-using-a-regular-expression



These sources provided valuable information on the construction and usage of regex patterns for email validation, as well as insights into the pedagogical aspects of teaching regex to new coders and other academics. This knowledge was incorporated into the creation of the comprehensive tutorial, which aimed to provide an accessible yet academically rigorous explanation of email validation using regex.
